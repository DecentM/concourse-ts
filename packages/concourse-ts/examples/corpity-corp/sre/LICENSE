NOTICE

While the package.json file in the same directory as this LICENSE file includes
the string "UNLICENSED" in its "license" field and states that it's private,
this example is licensed under MIT. This project inside the
examples/corpity-corp directory is an example of how an SRE or DevOps team might
use concourse-ts for its internal CI library, and as such it's marked as private
without a license as that's how internal packages are most often constructed.
